# Soil-Health-Monitoring-System

Problem Statement: 
Soil is for the farmer what the pulse is for the doctor. It helps them make decisions about when to irrigate, when and what to sow, use nutrients, and so on. While some farmers have indigenous knowledge of detecting soil moisture and health, such knowledge is confined to only a few. Taking farming decisions on the basis of soil moisture and health has become even more difficult in the age of climate change.

As soil health is important for the plant growth and productivity of Farming. Laboratory testing is time consuming process as it involves collecting soil sample from field , sending them to lab and receiving reports after few weeks.(means no real-time data acquisition) 
In spite of knowing about nutrient level in soil may farmer lacks the information about the crop that would be best suited to that field and end up with choosing crop failure.

Objective: 
Our aims to create a device which would help our farmers and agronomist to have real-time and round the clock analysis of nutrient (Macronutrient i.e. Nitrogen(N), Phosphorous(P), Potassium(K)) composition and some parameters such as soil pH, Temperature, Conductivity and Moisture status in the soil with apt suggestion about the crop that the soil is best suited for. And, also analyze the ambient temperature and humidity for better health of crops. 
We have created the most comprehensive soil probe measuring everything from NPK to other soil parameters and microclimate, all season long. Sensors are located at depth reporting on real-time soil conditions throughout the day and the collected data is sent to the cloud via either cellular or a standard internet connection which can be securely accessed on any cellular device or desktop computer. Also, all data display over LCD and webpage as well as on a mobile app.
